Data Types:

Below are primitive data types:

int
	Cannot hold decimal only integers
	Negative are allowed

Double:
	For keeping decimal values
	Can hold integers as well

char
	For holding single Char
	in single quotes
	

Boolean
	True or False

	
String
	String is a class not a data type
	Need to use double quotes
	
	
Concatenation
	Can concatenate string and int
	Using + symbol
	

System.out.print
System.out.println (prints in same line but add a new line at the end)	

++i  - pre increment, first increase and then asign

i++- first assign and then increase


\\static array:
int s[]= new int[5];

Static arrays have 2 disadvantages: 
1. Size is fixed: Can be overcome using collections, hashmaps
2. Holds same data type elements - Can be overcome using object class

object class array:
Object ob[]=new Object[40];

to fetch the size .length is used
for getting column in 2D array use ab[0].length



*****************************SUPER KEYWORD*****************************
Super keyword is used to call constructor of parent class from inside of child class
If super keyword is not written, by default the default constructor of parent class will be called while initializing object of child class
If written, Super keyword has to be the first statement inside the constructor of child class
